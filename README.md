## CHE525 Instrumentation Assignment
### Anna Thomas

<br/>

The three instruments that were wired were the coriolis flow meter, the two pressure sensors, and the RTD. Each were wired to the control panel in order to transmit information to DeltaV about each instrument.
1. The coriolis flow meter both indicates and transmits information about the mass flow of the fluid through the instrument. Additionally, the flow meter provides density, viscosity, and temperature related measurements.
2. The pressure sensor both indicates and transmits pressure readings.
3. The hydrostatic pressure sensor both indicates and transmits pressure readings.
4. The RTD transmits temperature readings.
